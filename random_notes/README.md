## [How aggressive do software engineers have to be to get promotions?](https://qr.ae/prT3gw)

by Mohammed Islam from Quora post

> - What’s the difference between a rockstar developer and a mediocre one? The rockstar’s software works as intended. Period.
> - When a software engineer does a good job, things work. They don’t work better, or more, or prettier. It just works, without any fuss, groans, or jerky behavior.
> - A good software architect can have 100x the impact on the company than the good developer does. But the impact is the kind where bad things didn’t happen. How do you give someone credit for what didn’t happen? So it requires courage, and boldness. And yes, sometimes aggression, to get the recognition that you deserve.
