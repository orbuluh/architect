> - What’s the difference between a rockstar developer and a mediocre one? The rockstar’s software works as intended. Period.
> - When a software engineer does a good job, things work. They don’t work better, or more, or prettier. It just works, without any fuss, groans, or jerky behavior.
> - A good software architect can have 100x the impact on the company than the good developer does. But the impact is the kind where bad things didn’t happen. How do you give someone credit for what didn’t happen? So it requires courage, and boldness. And yes, sometimes aggression, to get the recognition that you deserve.

## [What makes a 10x programmer/software engineer?](https://qr.ae/prNbQa)

by Jessica Su from Quora post

- You become a 10x engineer by making ten engineers twice as productive. You unblock other engineers and help them fix their most difficult issues.
- The whole system is broken and no one can do any work. Every hour the system is broken is 10 wasted hours of engineering time. You fix the system in 1 hour. You are a 10x engineer.
- Your friend would have spent three days fixing a bug. Instead, he asks you for help, and you solve it in 1 hour. Your 1 hour saved the other guy 24 business hours. You are a 24x engineer.
- Your friend writes a diff with a bug in it. You review the code and find the bug before he puts it in production. If it had made it to production, it would have cost 5 hours of time to fix, but you found it in 15 minutes. You are a 20x engineer.
- Your team’s code has no unit tests. You add a bunch of unit tests to the code. Other people copy the style of your code, so soon there are hundreds of unit tests. Now bugs that took days to catch are being found immediately. You are a 50x engineer.
- Your friend is doing a project. You learn that someone else on another team is doing exactly the same thing. You take them both out for ice cream, and they find a way to work together. They save 6 months of development time. You are a 200x engineer.
- Your friend is unhappy and thinking about leaving the company. You coach him and talk him through his problems. He becomes happier and decides to stay. Replacing him and ramping up a new team member would have taken 6 months. You are a 200x engineer.
